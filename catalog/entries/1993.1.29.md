Artist Statement: "Rescue Under Fire depicts the bond formed between fellow soldiers on the Indian Frontier. The young trooper has ridden in to rescue his unhorsed sergeant who has single-handedly been holding off the enemy. Learning to pick up fallen comrades was an integral part of the cavalryman's training. The period represented is the mid to late 1880s. Horse equipments are the 1885 regulation. Uniforms and weapons (except the sabre) are as current issue from the early 1880s and worn or used throughout the period. J.N.M."

Note: Certain artworks from this collection feature artistic practices and/or content and subject matter that depict American Indians as stereotypes and inaccurate characterizations, which necessitate curatorial analysis and thoughtful interpretation.
