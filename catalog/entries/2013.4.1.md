Reflection is a semi-permanent installation created for the Robert E. Kennedy Library at Cal Poly State University. Sited in the grand staircase, the modulated sculptural form echoes its surrounding context by climbing the wall and bouncing light from the nearby windows. It also literally reflects activity in the stairwell with subtle mirrored faces that animate the object with the movement of passersby. 

The proliferating diamonds also imitate the boundless potential of the learning process. In this digital age, information is all around us and Reflection manifests this through an expanding field of differentiated, but connected modules.  The installation is comprised of powder-coated aluminum and dry welded with rivets. Student volunteers helped to assemble the modules and a recent graduate, Eric Buckthall, engineered the lighting program for the embedded LEDs that emit a different sequence of colors during daylight and nighttime hours.
