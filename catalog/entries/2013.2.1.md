Outdoor bench depicting Albert Einstein seated. Edition 8/40 by Gary Lee Price. Dedication plaque reads: "Imagination is more important than knowledge. Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." "Donated by Paul and Sandi Bonderson, 2013"
