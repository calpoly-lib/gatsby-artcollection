Powder-coated steel installation by Anna Teiche. In honor
of Phil Bailey, dean emeritus of the College of Science and Mathematics, who founded
and championed the Study 25–35 Hours Per Week principle: To succeed, students
need to study two hours per unit each week, or the equivalent of 25–35 hours per
week.

“25–35” was conceptualized and designed by student Anna Teiche, who completed
all of the fabrication using on-campus resources and labs. Anna learned to TIG
weld with instruction from Doug Brewster and welding assistance from fellow Art
and Design student Tommy Stoeckinger.

The piece is a visual representation
of the activities in an average student’s day according to the Study 25-35 principle.
Each of the seven hexagonal panels represents a day of the week, and the smaller,
painted hexagons symbolize the hours in a day. The forms are inspired by molecular
diagrams used in chemistry, Dr. Bailey’s field of study. Just as chemical compounds
can be broken down into separate elements, a student’s day can be organized into
different areas of focus.

The artwork was commissioned by Kathleen Enz Finken,
Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs in honor of Phil Bailey.
