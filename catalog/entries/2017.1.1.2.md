Butterfly detail for mural "Integrated Visionaries" by artist David Ocelotl Garcia.

At the recommendation of student consultants, there is a series of butterflies located to the left of the central face—in dedication to the immigrants and undocumented students in the community.  Butterflies are often meant to symbolize transformation and growth, along with a sense of freedom. 

These butterflies represent how we want all undocumented students to feel as they dedicate themselves to furthering their education and building their futures.
