Indoor mural by artist David Ocelotl Garcia set within the Cal Poly Baker Center. 22' by 6' (132 sq. ft.)

Garcia’s murals interact with their environment to create a welcoming and vibrant atmosphere for the community, integrating his unique style of art that he refers to as “Abstract Imaginism.”

The artist’s vision was to create a powerful visual representation relating to the study of science and mathematics based on the themes of inclusivity, diversity, and community.

From the artist: "Integrated Visionaries depicts a community working together 
to explore and create significant advancements in society through science, math, social interaction, and art."
