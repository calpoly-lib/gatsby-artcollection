Cal Poly’s university art collection serves as an invaluable resource for teaching and research across disciplines. While a small portion of the collection is displayed throughout campus, there is opportunity for object-based learning with a selection of paintings, bronzes, and works on paper available for study.

## **ONLINE**

The Campus Art Catalog is an open online database of Cal Poly’s university art collection, which serves as a point of discovery and identification of selected artwork.

## **TEACHING AND RESEARCH ACROSS DISCIPLINES**

The university art collection internship empowers students to engage in a learn-by-doing experience with the art collection and promotes awareness of potential careers within the art management field. Interns help make accessible the university’s collection of fine art by assisting the campus curator with research, art handling, cataloging, and photography.
