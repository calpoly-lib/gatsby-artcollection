title: Class Visits to the Visible Storage Study Room
---
The university art collection is housed in a secure space that is designed to provide visual access to objects that are not on public display. Students and faculty have the opportunity for close viewing of objects through scheduled appointments in this visible storage study room.

Cal Polyâ€™s university art collection serves as an invaluable resource for teaching and research across disciplines.  While a small portion of the collection is displayed throughout campus, there is opportunity for object-based learning with a selection of paintings, bronzes, and works on paper available for study. Although this is an operating storage facility rather than a conventional exhibition gallery, Cal Poly faculty and students across disciplines are invited to schedule a class visit to view the collection.
